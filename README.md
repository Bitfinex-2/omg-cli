## omg-cli

This is a command line tool to interact with the OMG network. The main intention behind building it was to enable easier security testing by isolating end points and by provding a callable interfaces for both the contracts as well as the watcher component. 

### Installation


1.) Checkout the repository 
2.) Install `node` if you have not already. omg-cli has been tested with `node` 10.x but should work with other versions. Have not tested it though. 
3.) Run `npm install`
